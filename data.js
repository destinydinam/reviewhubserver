          review:
            "I recently purchased this iPhone Charger, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way possible. This charger set is an absolute game-changer for any iPhone user who values both speed and reliability. Let me share my experience and why I consider it a worthy investment.First and foremost, the charging speed is simply phenomenal. With the 20W power delivery, this charger provides lightning-fast charging for my iPhone. Gone are the days of endlessly waiting for my device to charge up. It efficiently charges my iPhone battery to full capacity in no time, allowing me to stay connected and productive throughout the day.The build quality of the charger adapter and cables is outstanding. Both the adapter and the cables are made of durable materials that feel sturdy and well-constructed. I appreciate the attention to detail, as they not only function flawlessly but also withstand the rigors of everyday use. The compact and lightweight design of the adapter makes it highly portable, making it a perfect travel companion.The inclusion of three 6FT Type C to Lightning cables is an absolute bonus. These cables are of high quality, featuring reinforced connectors that provide a secure and reliable connection. The generous length of the cables allows me to charge my device comfortably while using it, even when the wall socket is a bit far from my reach. Plus, having three cables ensures I always have a spare.Compatibility is not an issue with this charger set. It works seamlessly with all lightning-enabled devices, not just iPhones. Whether I'm charging my iPhone, iPad, or other lightning-compatible devices, this charger delivers consistent and efficient charging performance without any hiccups.In conclusion, the iPhone Fast Charger 3 Pack is a stellar product that lives up to its claims and delivers exceptional performance. With lightning-fast charging, durable construction, and multiple cables, this charger set is an excellent value for the price. If you're an iPhone user looking for a reliable and efficient charging solution, I highly recommend this charger set. It's an investment that will undoubtedly enhance your charging experience and keep you powered up at all times!",

            "I love these chargers. They are super cheap, and work really well. The only down side is that they don't use a typical USB, so I can't plug them into my computer, or another USB outlet, I have to always plug them into an outlet with the included plug. But, they are amazing for the price, and really great if you don't want to ruin your battery by charging overnight. I plug my phone in for 30 mins-an hour in the morning, and it is good for the day.",

The second charger work’s completely fine, lasted longer than the first one. Still works after my pup got to it, which gives it ⭐️3. Over all it’s fast charging which I can’t live without.

            "I recently purchased the iPhone Fast Charger and have had a satisfactory experience so far. The product delivers on its promise of fast charging, significantly reducing the amount of time my iPhone spends tethered to the wall. The built quality of the charger is also top-notch, giving a sense of durability and reliability.However, there's a premium attached to these positives. The price point is on the higher side compared to other chargers available in the market, which may not be as fast but offer similar functionality at a lower cost. Therefore, while I appreciate the fast charging capability and good quality, I would also expect a more competitive price for it to be considered great value for money.The delivery process was smooth, and the charger arrived in good condition. The packaging was secure, ensuring the charger was undamaged during transit.",

One issue I had was one USB power source I tried could not charge the phone and the watch at the same time but that is not the fault of this charge pad.  The second issue was that when I bought them I was using a couple apple style watch bands so no problems.  I switched recently to an AMBAND brand watch case and that does not work well with this charger.  The issue is the case is so thick (for protection) that it will not allow the correct alignment with the charging base.  The band is also so stiff that it prevents laying the watch flat on the charing puck.  I have to use the supplied Apple charger while my phone still sits on this charger.  I am here searching for another charing option.  These will be passed on to the wife and kid who still use the Apple style case and bands on their watches.  If you use the standard case and band, I do think that this charger would work great for you.",

Most notably I paid about four times this price for a well reviewed charger from Mophie/Zagg.  Looked great, worked horribly.  One of the three chargers never worked.  The other two required constant plugging and unplugging of the unit to get a charge.  I contacted Mophie and they sent a replacement.  The replacement was obviously a refurbished unit that show material wear and tear.  I refused it and elected to keep the original, new unit.  It never worked properly and, at best, only two of the charging areas worked.I was very skeptical of this unit, but loved the colors and pricing.  What an amazing charger.  Everything has worked perfectly.  I plan to buy a second unit.  Truly worth the money.  If this does ever break, I'd buy another in a heart beat.",

I was looking for something that would do well when I work from different locations and wanted a central charging hub.It works good as a charging hub, but I wish the charger was a little better as my iPhone 14 takes a while to charge. It also needs to be plugged in without anything connected. So if you need to disconnect for any reason, even briefly, all the devices have to come off.It also fails to charge my iWatch intermittently; I have to follow the steps above to fix it. This only happens on that port and not all the time.So I rated it down to 4 stars because of the glitches. Overall quality of good and charged well for an overnight set, but not very efficient for mobiles offices.",

It's especially helpful when traveling. I think things do charge a little slower than they would with a regular charger but that's generally the case when you're charging something that's not directly plugged into the wall itself. My only issue with it is the length of the cord. It would be helpful if the cord were longer or if there were different cord lengths included.

            "This charger seemed to work fine for a few months.  it can be pretty finicky for placement of your device to get it to charge, but it was working.  After a few months though, the blue light that indicates that your device is charging would start flashing and the device would stop charging.  This means that all night long, i would hear the \"ding\" as if I had just laid my phone on the charger and my phone would light up. I'd take my phone off the charger pad and the light would either stay on as if there was something still on it, or keep annoyingly flashing in my dark (trying to sleep) room.  I'd try to unplug it and plug it back in to no avail.  Not sure what's wrong with it but I definitely got a lemon!ETA: was contacted by seller and they sent me a new charger. Thank you!",

            "I used this in March for a trip and thought it was fabulous, even wrote an excellent review.  Now in May and have used it for two weeks so far and one week to go and it’s stopped working🤨. Luckily I brought the standard cables with me as a back up so I can charge my devices, however 3 months old and only used for 1.5 trips….not good.  I would like to ask the seller for an exchange but there’s no ability to contact them.  Sadly it looks like the expensive Apple MAG charger for which this was to be the cheaper equivalent maybe the only way to go:(Since writing this review the company has reached out to me…good customer service.  I hope to have this resolved soon and be back to having an excellent product:)",

            "I recently purchased the Apple MagSafe Charger, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. I bought it on July 12th, and since then, it has become an essential part of my daily routine. My primary expectation was that it would provide fast charging capabilities without the hassle of plugging in a cord, and it has delivered on that promise remarkably.The simplicity of the MagSafe Charger is its standout feature. With my iPhone 13 pro, all I need to do is place it on the charger, and it magnetically snaps into place, aligning perfectly every time. Plus, I paired it with a mount, allowing me to use my phone in portrait or landscape mode, making it convenient for various tasks, including taking video calls or watching content while charging.One of the most impressive aspects of this charger is its fast-charging capability. My iPhone charges up in no time, ensuring I'm always powered up and ready to go. I no longer have to fumble with lightning cables, which is a game-changer for me.In my 7-day experience with the MagSafe Charger, I haven't encountered any issues. It performs flawlessly, and the magnetic connection is secure enough that I don't have to worry about accidental disconnections.Overall, I can't recommend the Apple MagSafe Charger enough to fellow iPhone users. If you own an iPhone, this accessory is a must-have. It's fast charging, sleek design, and hassle-free experience make it worth every penny.Pros:Fast charging capabilitySecure magnetic connectionSleek and minimalistic designCompatible with MagSafe mounts for versatile phone usageCons:If you have an iPhone case that does not already have MagSafe capability, you will have to use it without the case or buy a new case.Would I Recommend? Absolutely! It's reliable and efficient and makes charging your phone a breeze. Go ahead and make the switch to wireless charging – you won't regret it!",

            "Update: I have upgraded my rating to 5 stars because one of my cables (OEM, USB-A to USB-C, designed for an older version of my phone) was not designed for high power charging, contrary to my initial belief. So if you are having issues when two devices are plugged in, check your cables first. Now I have no problem with this charger, which replaces two travel chargers.Old review (inaccurate):----------------------I use this charger with a Macbook Air, smartwatch, and cell phone. I've noticed that when I have two devices plugged in, one or both will stop charging. The smartwatch and phone will sometimes cycle between charging and not charging, as if I am plugging/unplugging them even though I haven't touched anything. My USB cables are either the OEM ones or rated for higher power than the OEM, so they are not the cause of this stop-charging issue. I haven't had time to figure out if there's a hack around this, i.e., which device to plug in first/last, but I shouldn't have to figure this out in the first place. Nevertheless, it deserves 3 stars because of its compact size and functional charging when one device is plugged in.",

It’s more secure than using a regular travel store type adapter and takes up less space.

          review:
            'Generally satisfied with this device, price, design and capability as follows:1. Price ($40) is mid-point; there are cheaper and more expensive ones from other China sourced companies.  See below - comes w/ UK, Europe AC adaptors that are $10 in value.2. GaN transformer element is both 1/2 smaller & lighter compared with prior-gen brick-type chargers.  The game changer of GaN is that the small size of GaN allows the merging of lap-top brick-type chargers w/ chargers for personal devices.  With laptops & goddam Apple going to C ports for new devices, there may be the Nirvana of one compact, travel & backup charger for all devices.  We may be there as legacy devices with micro-B & Lightning are removed from use.3. Product finish, I think is very good, with very good feel and look, and some "texture."  It\'s different from Apple look & feel of "white & smooth."4. Design - this has my requirement of a power indicator (small LED), and also combo USB B and C ports to run next-gen C and legacy devices on B.  There are 4 or 5 port chargers, but they may be too big for  the wall outlet or power bar.  If I need more ports (like charging 5 devices for the family in a hotel, I have another charger with an AC cord).5. Power - here\'s where everyone needs to pay attention to specs -  all PD (Power Delivery) chargers seem to be rated 65W ("Total"), but this unit is rated for FULL 65W when using 1 C port, while other, less capable, are rated for 45W for C only + 18W for B and they claim 65W.  In other words, this Minix can provide 65W for laptops while others provide 45W even when rated for 65-68W.Follow-on use.  A Dell 14” laptop and iPhone was connected and the Dell flashed a warning that the charger was providing “low power.”  This suggests another plugged in device will cause this charger to power down to 45W to the C port, and slow down charging of multiple devices.6. AC Power - it\'s 120-240V so with proper AC adapters, it can be used around the world by itself.  This charger comes with AC adaptors that cover all the popular places like UK & Europe.  The adaptors themselves are $10 value.  I have a very capable BaseUS-brand "multi-purpose" charger with all the features I want, BUT it\'s only 125V (WTF?).7. C Cable - DIDN\'T come with a C-cord for laptop power delivery (PD) while some other chargers do.  After-market C cables typically are very stiff (and easily kinked) and while C-cables attached OEM brick chargers for laptops are flexible & can be wound up.  Would have appreciated a flex C-cable for laptop PD.8. Durability - it\'s a TBD, and with every product out there, a % will go bad or is misused, who knows ?',

            "I was concerned that I wasn't buying the correct device for charging my laptop and phone on a recent trip to the UK. I was unsure how the higher electricity output would affect my devices. I found this wall charger to be worry-free and a great device to have on my trip. The adaptors included for the UK and Europe slide over the existing 2-prong North American plug, making for a solid connection. It has a small footprint and easily thrown in a backpack to bring along. The 3 charging ports also give you more options for plugging in devices. I teamed this up with 2 very long USB-A to Lightening cables so I could charge my phone while lying in bed at the hotel, and charging my laptop via the USB-C port overnight.",

            "I've been using this now for about 2 years, and have never had to replace this charger. I even ended up purchasing another one for me to use at my job!The textured back and soft silicone in the base of the stand make it so your device doesn't jostle around at all.Made of solid plastic construction that has never flexed, creaked, or cracked in the time I've used it.As long as you are plugged into a 15W charging brick or USB-C port on a computer you will get a decent charging speed.I suggest this for a place you spend a lot of time, such as an office desk or computer desk because 15W does mean that the average charge time is gonna be roughly 2 hours. This is no fault of the charger it's just meant for a more stationary usage. If you want a Fast Wireless charging experience be prepared to shell out an extra $50 dollars for it, but for what it is it's an unbeatable value.",

            "I bought this to replace an existing 10W mini \"pad\" wireless charger. I did some measurements with the Ampere application.The Good:It does show the old pad was stabilizing at around 840 mA while this one is stabilizing at around 1250mA. If you do the math, that's a 50% increase, which is consistent with this being a 15W charger. Of coarse nothing beats wired charging (I get around 2900 mA stabilized).The \"bad\":Its not really that bad, but it doesn't seem to charge my Z Fold 4 when unfolded. This is because the wireless charge components on the phone are off-center when folded. I can technically move it a bit to the left and it will charge, but the phone won't be steady there and I have to keep holding it.Conclusion:For what this unit promises it delivers. For those of us who have foldable devices, we should set expectations for this to charge when folded (portrait mode) and use it only as a stand when unfolded.Furthermore, although it is convenient to have a wireless charger, it is by no means a necessity, especially in the day and age of USB-C where plugging / unplugging a cable is effortless. Even in the best case scenario (15W wireless charging at 1250 mA of current), you can more than double that charge speed by simply plugging into a wired cable.PS: In case you haven't figured this out yet, I'm an Electrical Engineer and nerd ;-)",

Not only does it have a sleek and modern design that looks great on my desk, but its functionality is top-notch.Setup was a breeze; all I had to do was plug it in and place my phone on the stand. The convenience of being able to charge my phone without dealing with messy cables is a game-changer. The stand holds my phone securely in both portrait and landscape orientations, which is perfect for watching videos or video calls while charging.I'm impressed by the charging speed as well. My phone charges quickly and efficiently, and I love the fact that I can just grab my phone and go without worrying about unplugging any cords. The LED indicator light is subtle and not too bright, so it doesn't disturb me at night.The build quality is impressive too – the stand feels sturdy and well-made. It's evident that the manufacturer paid attention to the details. The anti-slip surface ensures that my phone stays in place, even on a slightly uneven surface.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The Iniu wireless charging stand has simplified my charging routine and added a touch of elegance to my workspace. If you're looking for a reliable, efficient, and stylish wireless charging solution, I highly recommend giving this stand a try!",

It makes it much easier to charge all of my devices in one place. So far, I haven't noticed it having any trouble keeping up with charging multiple devices. It's a little bit heavier than a normal charging block would be, so keep that in mind if you are working with a weight limit, but I think that's to be expected.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and I'm glad that I'll have it for other trips that I have coming up.",

Support most charging protocols especially the most important power delivery (PD) with PPS (important for Samsung Galaxy fast charging. At idle the charger consumes 0.3W (on a 230V grid) which is a little high and probably caused by the led light. Tested it at 20V/3.2A = 64W and it worked fine without getting to hot after a 20 minute run.Both C ports seem to have the same charging protocol characteristics (see photo for details).The power efficiency is good but not great. Below is a list of tested wattage and the wattage taken from the socket:20v/3.2A = 64W -> 69.3W20v/2A = 40W -> 43.6W12v/1A = 12W ->14W9v/1A = 9W -> 11WThere are more efficient chargers but this is still quite fine.As most multi-port chargers.

It's simple, sleek, and honestly I can't believe I didn't buy something like this a long time ago.Get one.",

            "I purchased it in Feb, it's now Nov & it's stopped \"SUPER FAST CHARGING\" It's starts of SFC then drops to just Fast Charging. I've tested it & it not my cable it's the box. That's so disappointing but I'm still giving it 4 stars. For $40 it should last longer than a few months. Maybe I just got dud. It was awesome I take it everywhere. It's small enough to drop in your pocket. Being able to charge the wife's, mine, & my son's cell with one box is awesome. I did notice the plug prongs did move together, now the move individualy. Maybe thats why I lost SFC.",

I thought I would get max output from this the block but regardless it's still fast charging just not to the amount expectedUpdated. Bought a second charger. And this one is not functional. It's within the return eligibility though so all is well. I guess sometimes lemons make it out the factory just be aware of that. My first charger is still going strong though.",

            "With so many iPhones and iPads in one house and especially with kids it seems like chargers either disappear or end up broken within a couple of weeks. It’s embarrassing to admit how many charging cables and cubes I’ve bought over the past few years. Having 10 feet of cable really improves the durability so there’s plenty of slack between the outlet and the area where our phones/iPads are charging (less stress on the connecting pieces). The usb-c charging cube and lighting cable really do charge quickly and unlike other brands these have lasted a few months through more abuse than they are intended and they still work. I like the fact that they are thin enough to only take up one outlet in a surge protector or wall outlet without blocking other outlets. I’d definitely purchase them again (and once these “disappear” I’ll probably have to). At this price point there’s really no downside. Just be careful if you’re a klutz like me that you don’t trip over such long cords (this is obviously not a brand specific issue. It’s a 10’ cord and uncoordinated consumer issue) This is my honest opinion as a consumer and a mom. I did not receive any free product or discount in exchange for my review.",
